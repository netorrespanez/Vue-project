#  ‚å® Implementation task

## Objectives
  - Implement the application as specified in the [README.md](./README.md)
  - Aim for a "Pixel perfect" UI
  - Provide a "Prod ready" code
  - Design the application with flexibility in mind (new API could be integrated)

## Rules
  - The time cap for this project is **5 hours**. This time does not include the documentation time you may need to learn the tech stack requested, you can spend additional time for this activity.
  - Because of the time cap you will probably have to make trade-offs, we will evaluate the choices you made and what you prioritized.
  - The tech stack should be based on [Vue.js 2](https://vuejs.org/v2/api/) and its ecosystem
  - This repo is dedicated to your work. Feel free to update directly the `master` branch.
